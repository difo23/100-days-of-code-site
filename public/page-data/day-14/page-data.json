I plan to review the concepts of the most representative patterns. At the end of the day I reviewed an introduction I had made about Google Colab, which is a very useful and free tool for students, teachers, and data scientists</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#scrollTo=5fCEDCU_qrC0\">Google Colaboratory:</a></h3>\n<p>Collaboratory, or Colab, allows you to write and run Python code in a browser, with:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>No configuration required</li>\n<li>Free GPU access</li>\n<li>Ease of sharing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It doesn't matter if you are a student, data scientist or AI researcher, Colab makes your job easier. Watch this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI\">introductory video</a> about Colab to learn more about it, or start using it below.</p>\n<p>Here is an introduction of my authorship to functionalities that I find interesting to have on hand in Google Colaboratory. <a href=\"https://github.com/difo23/BitacorasDataScienceDominicano\">Notebook</a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developerdecision.blogspot.com/2020/08/patrones-de-diseno-en-arquitectura-de.html\">The Layers architectural pattern:</a></h3>\n<p>I wrote a light introduction on this very important architectural pattern. Every software developer should spend a few hours increasing their skills as a software architect, the entire team benefits from this knowledge.</p>\n<p>The software architecture pattern known as \"Layers\" focuses on providing a set of guidelines so that the application can be decomposed into a group of subtasks in which each of these groups has a particular level of abstraction.</p>\n<p>You can check <a href=\"https://developerdecision.blogspot.com/2020/08/patrones-de-diseno-en-arquitectura-de.html\">my blog</a> and more Notebooks in &#x3C;a href=\"htt8</p>"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Lizandro's 100 Days of Code"}}},"pageContext":{"day":"14","title":" Google Colaboratory and Layer pattern"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1497828201","63159454"]}
