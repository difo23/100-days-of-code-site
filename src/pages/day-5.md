#### Description: 


Building a Restful API is a task that usually takes a long time if developed from scratch, it is a repetitive task and depending on the size of the project it can be a waste of resources. For this reason there are tools like Strapi that allow us to develop a Restful API in record time. In my portfolio project with Gastby we will use Strapi as an api for our blog and project data
