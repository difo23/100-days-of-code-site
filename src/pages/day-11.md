## Description:

Today I have dedicated myself to doing a rebuild an old API Rest , this time I decided to use a VSC extension called REST client instead of the reliable Postman. I don't think this extension will replace the functionalities and level of documentation that Postman provides, but the truth is that it is very easy to test your API without leaving VSC.
