# Description:
Microservices are not news anymore. They allow multiple teams to work autonomously by choosing their own technology stacks and having their own release cycles. There is something not being addressed though, like if it is some kind of dirty little secret, and that is frontend development. The common practice for building websites remains 'the monolith': a single frontend codebase that consumes multiple APIs. We believe we found a better solution.

Last year, a handful of Zalando engineers came up with an innovative solution for this exact problem - project Mosaic. Mosaic is a new architecture for websites where microservices are used in the entire stack, all the way to the frontend.

Weâ€™ve published Mosaic as open source. Its main components are:
Skipper - an HTTP router with runtime update of routes
Tailor - a streaming layout service with runtime update of templates

* Mosaic is a set of services, libraries together with a specification that defines how its components interact with each other, to support a microservice style architecture for large scale websites.

* In this article we'll describe a recent trend of breaking up frontend monoliths into many smaller, more manageable pieces, and how this architecture can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of teams working on frontend code.
