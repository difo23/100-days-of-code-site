# Description:
Today I was researching intelligent transportation systems, while doing research I came across an interesting open source project sponsored by the United States government. I'm going to spend a few days studying this project.

## OSS4ITS:  
Open source solutions support reuse and the deployment of interoperable transportation systems. OSS4ITS is a software suite providing infrastructure owners and operators, software companies, and device manufacturers with a clear picture of the available open source software tools for both technical and business audiences. Current OSS4ITS open source software platform repositories include the V2X Hub repository, Operational Data Environment (ODE) repository, Secure Data Commons (SDC) repository, and CARMASM repository.

## Program Resources  
* Data for Automated Vehicle Integration (DAVI)
* Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx)
* ITS DataHub
* ITS CodeHub
* Secure Data Commons (SDC)
* Opensource Solutions for ITS (OSS4ITS)
