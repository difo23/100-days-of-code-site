Select a portfolio piece to review and open it up. Next, use the questions below as suggestions to help you review your work. As you answer each question, you will identify areas for improvement. When you're done, you can make these changes to improve your portfolio!

**Is there anything missing? Are you missing steps in your projects, or details in your descriptions?**

- If you have a website, are all the pages you need accounted for?
- If you are hosting your portfolio on an existing platform, are all your projects uploaded properly?

**Is there too much info?** 

- Could any descriptions be revised for brevity?
- Are there places where you include more data than you need? Could something be cut without losing the meaning or context of your project?

**Is there anything you think you shouldn’t be included?**

- Have you included references to others’ work that helped you without citing them? Can you remove them and instead include links to external work?
- Are there any other components that might seem extraneous or unprofessional?

**Is your portfolio hosted on the most appropriate platform?**

- There are many options for a data analytics platform, such as GitHub, Kaggle, and more. Is the one you’re using (or plan on using) the most appropriate for your needs?
