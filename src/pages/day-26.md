# Description:
During this day I have been working on the web application on AWS, I have been putting off learning a little about AWS technologies and today seemed like the ideal day to start doing some tests on these popular tools. I have relied on one of the examples provided by the AWS page, the entire creation process and the final result were very illustrative.

### Problem:

In this tutorial, you will create a simple web application. You will first create a static "Hello World" website. Then you will learn how to add functionality to your website so that the displayed text is based on a custom input that you provide.

### What you will learn
This tutorial will walk you through the steps to create the sample web application mentioned above. You will learn how to do the following:

* Create a static website
* Connect the website to a serverless backend
* Add interactivity to your web application with an API and a database
