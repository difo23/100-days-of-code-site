# Kubernetes, Apache Kafka and Zookeeper.

## Day 23/100: Kubernetes-Docker and Apache Kafka-Zookeeper, a great ecosystem for micro-services.

### Kubernetes-Docker:

 As I researched Docker and containers, I observed its close relationship with Kubernetes and the topic of orchestrating containers to scale systems to enormous dimensions. Understanding the need for container orchestration broadens your curiosity about technologies that solve this problem such as Docker Swarm, Mesos, and the most popular Kubernetes so far.

### Apache Kafka-Zookeper:

With the introduction of the Event Bus concept in the asynchronous communication of microservices, we find the famous Apache Kafka, which in turn implement Apache Zookeeper. During my master's degree in the distributed system I had several close encounters with Zookeeper running inside Apache Storm, which does bring me a certain nostalgia. I'm going to do some basic testing with these systems individually to better understand their functionality within a microservice architecture.

### Continue Event Bus in Blog APP:
Continue small project on microservices in Node js and React, create simple Events Bus.
