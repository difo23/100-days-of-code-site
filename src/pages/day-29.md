# Description:

I am going to take this week to watch some videos on technologies that I have been learning on my own or reviewing in some cases for the classes I teach. From September 6 to September 13 I will be watching some of the tutorials on the [Freecodecamp channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ). The video I was watching on September 6 is a 5 hour bootcamp about Gatsby. The description and the link to the course, highly recommended.

## FreeCodeCamp: Gatsby Bootcamp:
Gatsby is a framework for creating blazing fast websites and web applications. Powered by React and GraphQL, Gatsby gives you everything you need to build and launch your next project. In this tutorial, you will learn everything you need to build and launch your first site with Gatsby. You’ll build a website from scratch and learn how to get it deployed to production.

## Server Side Rendered vs Statically Generated

When I started researching Gatsby I noticed that in many places they tend to create unnecessary competition between Next and Gatsby, as if they were tools designed for the same type of solutions. So do some research on these Server Side Rendered vs Statically Generated terms.

**Gatsby** is a static site generator tool. A static site generator generates static HTML on build time. It doesn’t use a server.

**Next.JS** is mainly a tool for server-side rendered pages. It dynamically generates the HTML every time a new request comes in with the use of a server.

I'm not going to go too deep into the pro's and cons of each here, however for some more in-depth reading check out:
