# Description:
During this day I have been working on the `ESCUELA` application, it is a personal project. The Login, signin and Student components are complete. The API for data acquisition of these components was also finalized. For now, I will continue to use a simple interface only to test the important functionalities of the application, in the end we will improve the details of the interface. All this update is in the branch refactoring.

### Problem:

Complete the editing and updating functionalities for Login, signin and Student.
