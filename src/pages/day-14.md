## Description:


Today I have focused on refreshing my knowledge about software architecture by focusing on the layer architecture pattern. I plan to review the concepts of the most representative patterns. At the end of the day I reviewed an introduction I had made about Google Colab, which is a very useful and free tool for students, teachers, and data scientists

### [Google Colaboratory:](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#scrollTo=5fCEDCU_qrC0)


Collaboratory, or Colab, allows you to write and run Python code in a browser, with:  

* No configuration required
* Free GPU access
* Ease of sharing

It doesn't matter if you are a student, data scientist or AI researcher, Colab makes your job easier. Watch this [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) about Colab to learn more about it, or start using it below.


Here is an introduction of my authorship to functionalities that I find interesting to have on hand in Google Colaboratory. [Notebook](https://github.com/difo23/BitacorasDataScienceDominicano)

 ### [The Layers architectural pattern:](https://developerdecision.blogspot.com/2020/08/patrones-de-diseno-en-arquitectura-de.html)

I wrote a light introduction on this very important architectural pattern. Every software developer should spend a few hours increasing their skills as a software architect, the entire team benefits from this knowledge.

The software architecture pattern known as "Layers" focuses on providing a set of guidelines so that the application can be decomposed into a group of subtasks in which each of these groups has a particular level of abstraction.
