# Description:
This full course introduces the concept of client-side artificial neural networks. We will learn how to deploy and run models along with full deep learning applications in the browser! To implement this cool capability, we’ll be using TensorFlow.js (TFJS), TensorFlow’s JavaScript library.

By the end of this video tutorial, you will have built and deployed a web application that runs a neural network in the browser to classify images! To get there, we'll learn about client-server deep learning architectures, converting Keras models to TFJS models, serving models with Node.js, tensor operations, and more!
