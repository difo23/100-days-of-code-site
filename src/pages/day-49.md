# Description:
During this week I have abandoned the challenge of 100 days of code a little, mainly to organize improvements on some projects that I have been putting off for a long time. Thank God we are now ready to continue with the challenge, this time drawing a little inspiration from the projects proposed by Ã“scar Barajas. In my case, I will do the projects with technologies that I am currently learning to add a degree of difficulty.

The first project I will work on will be GitHub Jobs. But I'll add a few more layers of difficulty to it on the backend and I'll work on the front using TypeScript. I am going to work the backend as a micro service so I will use two databases of different technologies. Today I will plan this project.
