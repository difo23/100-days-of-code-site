# Description:
During this week I have abandoned the challenge of 100 days of code a little, mainly to organize improvements on some projects that I have been putting off for a long time. Thank God we are now ready to continue with the challenge, this time drawing a little inspiration from the projects proposed by Óscar Barajas. In my case, I will do the projects with technologies that I am currently learning to add a degree of difficulty.

The first project I will work on will be GitHub Jobs. But I'll add a few more layers of difficulty to it on the backend and I'll work on the front using TypeScript. I am going to work the backend as a micro service so I will use two databases of different technologies. Today I will plan this project.

### GitHub Jobs
Challenge: Create a job search using an API. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Don’t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:  

User story: I can see a list of jobs in a city by default  
User story: I can search for jobs with a given keyword  
User story: I can search for jobs with a city name, zip code or other location  
User story: I can select one option from at least 4 pre-defined options  
User story: I can search for a full-time job only  
User story: I can see a list of jobs with their logo, company name, location, and posted time.  
User story: When I select a job, I can see job descriptions and how to apply like the given   design.  
User story: When I am on the job details page, I can go back to the search page  
User story (optional): I can see a list of jobs in the closest city from my location by default  
User story (optional): I can see jobs in different pages, 5 items each page  
Icon: https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/
  
API: https://jobs.github.com/api  

Tips: For Front-end developer, you can use https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ to help with accessing data from other websites that are normally forbidden by the same-origin policy of web browsers  

As long as you fulfill all the user stories, you can give your personal touches by adding transition, using your own images, changing colors, or even creating your own layout,...  

Remember to put your name on the footer to prevent other from submitting your solutions.
