## Description:

Rebuild an old mongoDB database and write some blogs about Big O and Sliding Windows.

### Big O:


In simple words, we can consider the Big O as a classification system for the behavior of our algorithms based on the amount of data they work with. Keeping the above in mind we can represent the Big O as a large panoramic photograph without superfluous details about the behavior of an algorithm based on its input data.

### Sliding Windows algorithms #1:

These exercises that we will present below are based on the Slinding Windows strategy. Apply this technique to problems where it is necessary to go through a list of elements where you have to search or calculate something from subarrays with consecutive elements of size k elements.

### Sliding Windows algorithms #2:


Given a string (st) and a pattern (pt), find out if the string contains any permutation of the pattern.  [more...](https://developerdecision.blogspot.com/2020/08/tecnicas-de-algoritmos-deslizamiento-de_20.html)
